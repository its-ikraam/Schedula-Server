### Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it through various endpoints. Use tools like Postman or cURL to test the API.

### Endpoints

Here are some of the key endpoints available in **Schedula-Server**:

- `POST /events`: Create a new event.
- `GET /events`: Retrieve a list of events.
- `GET /events/:id`: Get details of a specific event.
- `PUT /events/:id`: Update an existing event.
- `DELETE /events/:id`: Delete an event.

### Health Monitoring

Health monitoring is crucial for maintaining server performance. You can check the health status of the server by hitting the `/health` endpoint. This will return a simple JSON response indicating the server's status.

### Logging

Logging is essential for tracking activities and debugging issues. **Schedula-Server** uses Winston for logging. You can find logs in the `logs` directory. Ensure to manage log levels based on your environment (development, production).

### Testing
